# Challenge Front End

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6 so it can match the desired Angular version with the 5.2.

## GetStarted

Open a command line in this folder and do:

- `npm install`
- `ng serve` or `npm start`

And that's it.

If you want to run tests, do `ng test`.

## Summmary

This app is containing two components and a service:

- **[CalculatorComponent]()**
  - This component is the one asked for exercise 1 and 2 of the challenge
- **[FormCalculatorComponent]()**
  - This component is the one asked for exercise 3 of the challenge, it is usable inside a ReactiveForm (FormGroup)
- **[CalculatorService]()**
  - This service is responsible for asking the api for cards for a specific amount

Only the **CalculatorComponent** has a test file attached to it. This test file isn't doing all the needed tests to ensure proper maintainability, but it has some tests to show I can write them. (plus some TODO tests in comment)
